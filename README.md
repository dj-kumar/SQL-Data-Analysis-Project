# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, our goal is to analyze international debt data sourced from The World Bank. The dataset includes information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. Our analysis will focus on answering specific questions:

What is the overall debt amount owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Which country has the highest debt, and what is the corresponding amount?
What is the average debt amount across different debt indicators for countries in the dataset?
